    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ice coffee can be prepared in different ways but our way usually is
      tastier. It is mostly consumed on hotter days in summer. The key is to
      prepare a jug of hot, preferably filter coffee at first. Do not try to
      make cold coffee instantly as this will result in bad taste.
